	abstract = {Ingestion of wild and potentially toxic mushrooms is common in the United States and many other parts of the world. US poison centers have been logging cases of mushroom exposure in The National Poison Data System (NPDS) annual publications for over 30 years. This study compiles and analyzes US mushroom exposures as reported by the NPDS from 1999 to 2016. Over the last 18 years, 133 700 cases (7428/year) of mushroom exposure, mostly by ingestion, have been reported. Cases are most frequently unintentional (83\%, P {\textless} 0.001); cause no or only minor harm (86\%, P {\textless} 0.001); and in children {\textless}6 years old (62\%, P {\textless} 0.001). Approximately 704 (39/year) exposures have resulted in major harm. Fifty-two (2.9/year) fatalities have been reported, mostly from cyclopeptide (68-89\%)-producing mushrooms ingested by older adults unintentionally. The vast majority of reported ingestions resulted in no or minor harm, although some groups of mushroom toxins or irritants, such as cyclopepides, ibotenic acid, and monomethylhydrazine, have been deadly. Misidentification of edible mushroom species appears to be the most common cause and may be preventable through education.},

This article is an inquiry into ecological rationality, heuristics, perception, and decision-making in mushroom foraging. By surveying 894 Finnish mushroom foragers, this article illustrates how socially learned rules of thumb and heuristics are used in mushroom foraging, and how simple heuristics are often complemented by more complex and intuitive decision-making. The results illustrate how traditional foraging cultures have evolved precautionary heuristics to deal with uncertainties and poisonous species, and how foragers develop selective attention through experience. The study invites us to consider whether other human foraging cultures might use heuristics similarly, how and why such traditions have culturally evolved, and whether early hunter-gatherers might have used simple heuristics to deal with uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Background
Mushrooms are popular food items containing numerous vitamins, dietary fibers, and a large number of proteins. As a result, mushrooms can increase the body’s immunity and prevent many types of cancer to keep the body healthy. For these reasons, the demand for high yields and safety in the production of high-quality mushrooms is increasing.
Scope and approach
This review highlights the application of computer vision and machine learning algorithms in the mushroom industry. Through a systematic review of papers published between 1991 and 2021, this article introduces key aspects related to mushrooms (e.g., species identification and quality classification based on artificial intelligence), and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches.
Key findings and conclusions
Numerous artificial intelligence and machine vision technologies have been implemented in research efforts focusing on edible fungi. However, their applications are generally limited to the identification of poisonous mushrooms according to their forms, the plucking of cultivated mushrooms covered by soil, and the mechanized grading of mushrooms. Clearly, the currently available methods cannot meet the requirements of the digitization and intelligentization in the field of edible mushrooms. Considering these reasons, it is possible to develop further application opportunities, such as digital mushroom phenotype determination, and high-throughput breeding based on big data, and mechanical picking by a harvesting robot as well. Therefore, the integration of computer vision and machine learning with the development of more efficient algorithms will undoubtedly be a hotspot for future studies in the context of the mushroom industry.},

	abstract = {Of the millions of mushroom species growing all around the world, one type is edible, while the other is poisonous. It is not easy to distinguish edible and poisonous mushrooms from each other and it is a condition that requires expertise. The classification of poisonous and edible mushrooms is therefore important. Machine learning algorithms are an alternative method for classifying poisonous and edible mushrooms using morphological or physical features of fungi. The dataset used in this study is the Mushroom dataset available in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Based on 22 features in the Mushroom dataset and four different machine learning algorithms, models have been created for the classification of edible and poisonous fungi. The classification success rates of these models were obtained from Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and AdaBoost algorithms with 90.99\%, 98.82\%, 99.98\% and 100\%, respectively. When these results were examined, taking into account the physical appearance features of the mushrooms, it was determined whether the mushrooms were edible and poisonous by 100\% with the AdaBoost model.},

Classification process of poisonous mushroom or not will be easily conducted by learning machine using mining data as one of the ways to extract computer assisted knowledge. Currently, there are three comparisons of the best classification algorithms in data mining, namely: Decision Tree (C4.5), NaïveBayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The study method used is experiment with assisted tool of WEKA that has been testing in the comparison of the three algorithms. To conduct the testing, it is used the mushroom data of Agaricus and Lepiota family. The mushroom data were taken from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms, in UCI machine learning repository. Results of the testing indicate that the C4.5 algorithm has the same accuracy level to the SVM by 100\% however, from the speed aspect, process of the C4.5 algorithm is faster than the SVM.},

The investigators designed the experiment in which 200 samples were randomly assigned to the mushroom population, consisting of 200 equally toxic and nontoxic mushrooms. For the quality, many ML were comparison such as Naive Bayes Updateable, Naive Bayes, SGD Text, LWL and K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN).

Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) method has been used along with InceptionV3 to obtain the highest test accuracy.

While deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) became monarch in image based recognition, the large number of possible architectures, the alternatives of training, the setting-up of proper data-sets, the settings of hyperparameters are making headaches for the researchers and developers to find optimal solutions for classification problems. In our article we are to solve a mushroom classification task by systematically going through the above key questions. First, we introduce how we created and cleaned a proper data-set for training, then why we selected a specific neural network considering the constraints of limited hardware resources. We go through different alternatives for training such as transfer learning, gradual freezing, changing model size, incremental-size learning, and also applying task specific subnetworks. Performance evaluation is made on our data-set of 106 species, the best approach reaching 92.6\% accuracy.},

The research approach employed was an experiment with a WEKA-assisted tool that was used to compare the four algorithms. The Lepiota mushroom and Agaricus data were used to conduct the testing.
